# Mutiny Wallet

Mutiny Wallet is a lightning wallet that runs in the web. Mutiny is unlike other lightning apps on Start9, it is not a
server that you run on your Embassy. Instead, it is a web app that you can access from any device on your local network.
This means that you can access your wallet from your phone, tablet, or laptop.

This comes pre-packaged with VSS and the websocket proxy, so everything you need to run a lightning wallet is included.

The only external dependency is esplora, which is used to get blockchain data. This can be configured in the settings
page if you have your own esplora instance running.
